## 🚀 Deployment Notes

> 💡 As of April 2025, GitHub deprecated `upload-artifact@v3`. This project uses the updated `v4` action.

To redeploy:
1. Push changes to `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will auto-build and deploy to GitHub Pages.
3. If deployment fails, re-run the workflow manually from the **Actions** tab.

## 🧩 Planned for Future Versions

- Add more real-world projects
- Flask/Django backend integration
- Blog section with markdown rendering
- API-based contact form with SMTP/EmailJS
- Scrollspy navigation and project filters

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- DNS and CNAME setup can be tricky for beginners — but sticking through it taught me a lot about deployment.
- Debugging GitHub Actions helped me understand real-world CI/CD pipelines.
- The web is never just "HTML and CSS" — it’s problem-solving all the way!
